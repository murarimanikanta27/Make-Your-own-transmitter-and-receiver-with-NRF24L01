# Long-Range Wireless Transmitter and Receiver with NRF24L01

## Overview

This project involves building a custom long-range wireless transmitter and receiver using the NRF24L01 module with a range of up to 1.2 km. The system is controlled by Arduino Uno microcontrollers. The transmitter is equipped with a dual-axis joystick and a potentiometer, while the receiver controls a servo motor and a DC motor based on the input from the transmitter.

## Features

- **Long-Range Communication**: Utilizes the NRF24L01 module to achieve wireless communication over a distance of up to 1.2 km.
- **Joystick Control**: The dual-axis joystick at the transmitter allows for precise control of the motors at the receiver.
- **Potentiometer Input**: The potentiometer at the transmitter provides an additional control input for the receiver.
- **Motor Control**: The receiver controls both a servo motor and a DC motor, enabling various mechanical functions.
- **Arduino-Based**: Both the transmitter and receiver are powered by Arduino Uno, making the system easy to program and modify.

## Components

### Transmitter

- **Arduino Uno**: The microcontroller that processes input from the joystick and potentiometer.
- **NRF24L01 Module**: Provides wireless communication to the receiver.
- **Dual-Axis Joystick**: Allows for directional control of the motors at the receiver.
- **Potentiometer**: Provides an additional control input, such as speed or position.

### Receiver

- **Arduino Uno**: The microcontroller that receives data from the transmitter and controls the motors.
- **NRF24L01 Module**: Receives wireless data from the transmitter.
- **Servo Motor**: Responds to the joystick input for precise angular control.
- **DC Motor**: Controlled by the potentiometer or joystick, depending on your configuration.

## Wiring Diagrams

### Transmitter

1. **Joystick**: Connect the X and Y outputs to the analog pins on the Arduino (e.g., A0 and A1). Connect the VCC and GND to 5V and GND on the Arduino.
2. **Potentiometer**: Connect the middle pin to an analog pin (e.g., A2), and the other two pins to 5V and GND.
3. **NRF24L01 Module**: 
   - VCC to 3.3V on Arduino
   - GND to GND on Arduino
   - CE to digital pin 9
   - CSN to digital pin 10
   - SCK to digital pin 13
   - MOSI to digital pin 11
   - MISO to digital pin 12

### Receiver

1. **NRF24L01 Module**: Same wiring as the transmitter.
2. **Servo Motor**: Connect the control wire to a PWM digital pin (e.g., D3) on the Arduino, and the power wires to 5V and GND.
3. **DC Motor**:
   - Use an H-Bridge motor driver (e.g., L298N).
   - Connect the motor terminals to the output pins of the H-Bridge.
   - Connect the input pins of the H-Bridge to digital pins on the Arduino (e.g., D4 and D5).
   - Power the H-Bridge with an external power supply suitable for the motor.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transmitter-receiver-nrf24l01.git
   cd transmitter-receiver-nrf24l01
   ```

2. **Upload the Code**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - For the transmitter, open the `transmitter.ino` file.
   - For the receiver, open the `receiver.ino` file.
   - Connect your Arduino Uno to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Select the correct board and port from the Arduino IDE.
   - Click on the Upload button to upload the code to each Arduino.

3. **Assemble the Circuit**:
   - Follow the wiring diagrams above to connect all components.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and correct.

4. **Power Up**:
   - Provide power to both the transmitter and receiver setups.
   - The transmitter will send joystick and potentiometer data to the receiver.
   - The receiver will control the servo motor and DC motor based on the received data.

## How It Works

1. **Data Transmission**: The NRF24L01 module at the transmitter sends the joystick and potentiometer values wirelessly to the receiver.
2. **Motor Control**: The receiver processes the incoming data and adjusts the servo motor's angle and the DC motor's speed or direction accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Communication**: Ensure that both NRF24L01 modules are properly connected and that their power supply is 3.3V. Double-check the CE and CSN pin configurations.
- **Servo Motor Not Moving**: Verify the PWM pin connection and ensure the servo is receiving adequate power.
- **DC Motor Not Responding**: Check the connections between the H-Bridge and the Arduino, and ensure the motor driver is properly powered.
